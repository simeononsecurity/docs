# Maintaining and Optimizing the XNET Network

Maintaining and optimizing an **XNET network** is crucial for ensuring its longevity and effectiveness. Whether you're managing a small deployment or a large-scale network, it's essential to monitor network health, implement robust security protocols, and provide reliable customer support. This guide will walk you through the key steps to keep your XNET network running smoothly and efficiently.

______

## Monitoring Network Health

### Using Third-Party Hardware and Tools for Network Performance Monitoring

To ensure your XNET network is performing at its best, **monitoring network health** is a critical task. While the XNET Dashboard provides valuable insights, it currently doesn't support real-time monitoring of connected Wi-Fi devices. For deployers seeking more detailed, real-time metrics, using third-party hardware and tools is highly recommended.

- [**GL.iNet GL-SFT1200 (Opal) Secure Travel WiFi Router:**](https://amzn.to/3UqNc8d) This affordable device offers comprehensive features for robust network management. It can be integrated with [**GoodCloud.xyz**](https://www.goodcloud.xyz/), a cloud management service that allows for real-time and remote monitoring of network activities across your XNET offload devices.
  
- [**Eero Devices:**](https://amzn.to/3yOMYjo) For those looking for a simpler setup with real-time monitoring capabilities, **Eero devices** are an excellent option. Though slightly more expensive, they provide user-friendly interfaces and reliable performance.

Using these tools, you can monitor signal strength, detect dead zones, and track the number of connected devices in real time. This proactive approach allows you to address potential issues before they escalate.

### Understanding Common Network Issues and How to Resolve Them

**Common network issues** can include weak signal strength, interference, and connectivity drops. Understanding these problems and knowing how to troubleshoot them is essential for maintaining a high-performing network.

- **Weak Signal Strength:** Often caused by physical obstructions or improper placement of access points (APs). Solution: Reposition APs to more central locations, away from walls or large metal objects, and consider adding additional APs to cover larger areas.
  
- **Interference:** Can result from other wireless networks or electronic devices operating on the same frequency. Solution: Use a WiFi analyzer tool to identify and switch to less congested channels.
  
- **Connectivity Drops:** May be due to overloaded APs. Solution: Regularly monitor the number of connected devices to ensure no single AP is overwhelmed.

By staying on top of these issues, you can maintain a stable and reliable XNET network.

## Security Protocols

### On-Site Security Considerations

Physical security is as important as digital security. Protecting your network's physical infrastructure helps prevent tampering and unauthorized access.

#### Implementing VLANs and VRFs

**Virtual LANs (VLANs)** and **Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRFs)** are effective ways to segment network traffic and enhance security.

- **VLANs:** Isolate different types of traffic, such as guest Wi-Fi and internal communications, to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
  
- **VRFs:** Allow multiple routing tables to exist on the same router, further isolating traffic and enhancing security.

#### DNS Sinkholing, IDS/IPS, and Threat Prevention

**DNS Sinkholing** redirects malicious traffic away from its intended destination, effectively neutralizing potential threats.

- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** and **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):** These tools help monitor for suspicious activity and block threats in real time, ensuring that the network remains secure.

- **Threat Prevention:** Implementing a robust threat prevention strategy, including regular security audits and updates, is essential for maintaining network integrity.

______

## Customer Support and Troubleshooting

### Providing Ongoing Support to Venue Owners

Maintaining a strong relationship with venue owners is key to the long-term success of your XNET deployment. Providing **ongoing support** ensures that the network continues to meet their needs and remains reliable.

- **Regular Check-Ins:** Schedule regular check-ins with venue owners to discuss network performance and address any concerns they may have.
  
- **Training:** Offer training sessions for venue staff to help them understand the basics of network management and troubleshooting.

### How to Respond to Technical Issues Quickly and Effectively

When technical issues arise, **quick and effective responses** are crucial. Hereâ€™s how to handle common scenarios:

- **Remote Troubleshooting:** Use the real-time monitoring tools mentioned earlier to diagnose and resolve issues remotely whenever possible.
  
- **On-Site Visits:** For more complex problems, schedule an on-site visit to assess and fix the issue directly.

- **Documentation:** Maintain thorough documentation of all network configurations and past issues to streamline future troubleshooting efforts.

## Real-Time Network Monitoring with XNET Limitations

While the **XNET Dashboard** offers valuable insights, it currently doesn't support the display of Wi-Fi devices connected to the network. This limitation means that users seeking detailed, real-time metrics of their network activity need alternative solutions.

### Alternatives for Real-Time Monitoring

For those requiring real-time network monitoring, **third-party devices** like the **GL.iNet GL-SFT1200 (Opal) Secure Travel WiFi Router** or **Eero devices** are excellent choices. These tools provide the ability to track network performance, monitor connected devices, and identify issues as they arise.

- [**GoodCloud.xyz Integration:**](https://www.goodcloud.xyz/) The GL.iNet router can be integrated with **GoodCloud.xyz**, a cloud management service that facilitates real-time monitoring across multiple devices. This setup is particularly useful for managing large networks with numerous access points.

By leveraging these tools, you can overcome the limitations of the XNET Dashboard and maintain full visibility into your network's performance.

______

## Conclusion

**Maintaining and optimizing an XNET network** requires a combination of proactive monitoring, robust security practices, and reliable customer support. By using third-party tools for real-time monitoring, implementing best-in-class security protocols, and staying responsive to venue owners' needs, you can ensure your network remains efficient and secure. As technology evolves, staying informed about the latest advancements in network management will further enhance the effectiveness of your XNET deployments.
