# Acceptable and Unacceptable Use of XNET WiFi APs and the XNET Network

## Acceptable Use

- **Installation Compliance**  
  Installing XNET APs (Access Points) according to all manufacturer, XNET, and [Wi-Fi best practices](https://docs.xnet.company/installing_xnet_wifi_devices/).

- **Proper Location**  
  Installing APs in business or public locations with high foot traffic and long dwell time, such as cafes, malls, or parks, ensuring legitimate use and automatic offload by users.  
  *Residential or private locations are not acceptable* unless they meet these criteria. For more details, refer to [Identifying Ideal Locations](https://docs.xnet.company/identifying_ideal_deployment_locations/).

- **Accurate Location Reporting**  
  Providing the **accurate location** of the AP during registration to ensure proper network functioning and avoid disruptions.

- **Sufficient Internet Speed**  
  Ensuring the internet uplink provides enough bandwidth, guaranteeing **at least 20 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload per user** to maintain a good user experience.  
  Typically, this means having gigabit internet where possible, as **1 Gbps** can support 50 users at peak usage and potentially more during sustained periods.

- **Commercial-Grade Backhaul**  
  The backhaul connection must be **commercial-grade** (i.e. unlimited business internet plan), not subject to usage caps or throttling, and must provide consistent speeds to support multiple users.  
  *Cellular-based backhaul, whether business class or not, is unacceptable for XNET APs due to potential limitations in speed and reliability.*

- **User Connection Method**  
  Allowing users to connect **automatically** to the XNET network without manual intervention, ensuring the network operates smoothly as designed.

- **Device Security & Integrity**  
  Ensuring the XNET AP is **securely installed** and free from tampering, ensuring data integrity and network reliability.

## Unacceptable Use

- **Lying About Registration Location**  
  Providing **false location information** during registration, which can disrupt network optimization and fair usage distribution.

- **Poor Installation Practices**  
  Installing APs in a way that does not follow XNET or Wi-Fi best practices, which could result in a **poor user experience** or signal degradation.

- **Inadequate Internet Speed**  
  Connecting an AP to an internet uplink that cannot guarantee **at least 20 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload per user**, leading to a suboptimal user experience.

- **Cellular-Based Backhaul**  
  *Using cellular-based backhaul for APs, even if it is a business-class connection, is unacceptable* as it may introduce performance issues, usage limits, or throttling.

- **Residential Installations**  
  Installing APs in **residential areas** or locations with low foot traffic and short dwell times, which would not get legitimate offload.  
  APs must be installed in businesses or public areas to ensure proper use.

## Fraudulent Use and Traffic Manipulation

- **Traffic Manipulation**  
  Manipulating user traffic, AP configurations, or devices in a way that could harm network integrity, security, or performance.

- **Unusually High Usage**  
  Gaming the network by purposefully consuming **unusually high bandwidth** relative to the average user or session, leading to potential throttling or disruption for other users.

- **Manual Connection to APs**  
  **Manually attempting to connect** to XNET APs in any way unless explicitly directed by XNET Support, which could interfere with the automatic user offload process.

- **Using the AP as a Personal Router**  
  Using the XNET AP for personal use or as a **personal router**, which is a violation of the intended purpose of providing public access and offload.

- **Banned Devices, Operators, or Locations**  
  XNET reserves the right to **ban any device, operator, or location at any time** for violations of network policy.  
  If the ban is imposed by an upstream partner, such as a carrier, the ban is **non-revocable** and must be adhered to indefinitely. For more details, refer to the [Banned Devices List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zG0857rhkeRn-0lj_1k9Nn08Rw2x06xJQAT7cRTgwyQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

## Additional Considerations

- **Banned Devices List**  
  Ensure the use of only approved devices, avoiding any banned devices listed in the [Banned Devices List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zG0857rhkeRn-0lj_1k9Nn08Rw2x06xJQAT7cRTgwyQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

- **Processing Time**  
  Even in situations that qualify as acceptable use, there may be a delay of **up to 30 days** between the registration of a device and the start of qualified data offload that would result in rewards being granted.  
  *Until the device is qualified, rewards will not start.* It is imperative that you comply with this document to speed up that qualification process.

- **Purchasing Recommendations**  
  It is highly recommended to purchase your Wi-Fi access points from the official **XNET store** (link).  
  These devices are brand new, include all required accessories, and are pre-provisioned for seamless activation on the network.

- *We do not recommend purchasing third-party devices unless you know the seller well.*  
  If you are considering purchasing a used XNET device, make sure to check it against the [banned devices list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zG0857rhkeRn-0lj_1k9Nn08Rw2x06xJQAT7cRTgwyQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0) to avoid issues with network onboarding.  
  **Banned devices cannot be reactivated** and are not eligible for receiving rewards.
