All XNET models support **Wi-Fi 6**, with some like the **XR560** also offering **Wi-Fi 6E** for even faster speeds and higher capacity. **MU-MIMO technology** is standard across models, allowing for multiple users to connect simultaneously without sacrificing speed.

### Antenna Design
Antenna design plays a crucial role in the performance of an access point. The **XPX6** and **XV2-2T0** feature advanced **omnidirectional antennas** that provide broad coverage, making them ideal for outdoor and large area deployments. In contrast, the **XP6-Pro** has an **internal antenna** that is more suitable for indoor settings where space and design are considerations.

### Weatherproofing and Durability
For outdoor models like the **XPX6** and **XT350**, weatherproofing is a critical feature. These models come with **IP68** and **IP67 ratings**, respectively, ensuring they can handle rain, dust, and extreme temperatures.

### Power Over Ethernet (PoE)
All XNET models support **Power Over Ethernet (PoE)**, simplifying the installation process by allowing the access point to receive power through the same cable used for data transmission. This feature is especially beneficial in environments where running separate power lines would be impractical or costly.
